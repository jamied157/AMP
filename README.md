Summer Project on Approximate Message Passing

This repository contains the code I used on a summer project in the University of Cambridge Maths department. The aim of the project was to use a statistical inference technique known as approximate message passing on an existing problem in Metagenomics. I aim to include a pdf that goes into more detail about this in the future.

To most illustrative place to start is the point mixture folder, here I reconstructed the first example in the paper
> Estimation of Low-Rank Matrices via Approximate Message Passing - https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01682
